                <p>
                        My short term goals are to build a background and portfolio in programming, obtain networking contacts,
                        attend school, and to support these goals by maintaining a part-time or full-time job.
                        My long term goal is to start a career in programming.
                         While in Tampa, I strive to better my surrounding community and environment through volunteer programs
                         and responsible living. I value punctuality, reliability, and work ethic.
